Make sure to install the package Newtonsoft for JsonConvert

Sln and .cs available in the zip.

FOR SOME REASONS, the Sln doesn't want to open, ( I passed my whole saturday trying to make it work, when the project is in a folder, it opens, but when i put it in a zip, it doesn't work anymore..)

Solution for you to open it : download my zip, and open my Sln directly from Vscode ( or rider ); it should work.

Thank you and sorry i am very confused about that i didn't find the solution
